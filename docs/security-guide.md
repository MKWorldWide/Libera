# üîí Libera Security Guide

## üåü Security Philosophy

Libera's security architecture is built on the principle that **justice systems must be both secure and transparent**. Every security measure serves to protect the innocent while maintaining the integrity of evidence and due process.

## üõ°Ô∏è Defense-in-Depth Strategy

### 1. üîê Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-factor authentication** for all user accounts
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) with granular permissions
- **JWT tokens** with short expiration times (24 hours)
- **Session management** with automatic logout on inactivity

### 2. üîí Data Protection
- **PII minimization** through cryptographic hashing
- **End-to-end encryption** for sensitive data in transit
- **Database encryption** at rest using PostgreSQL's built-in features
- **Secure file storage** with access controls and integrity checks

### 3. üìä Audit & Monitoring
- **Immutable audit logs** with cryptographic signatures
- **Real-time anomaly detection** for suspicious activities
- **Differential privacy** for external oversight
- **Comprehensive logging** of all system activities

---

## üîê Authentication Security

### User Registration
- **Credential validation** against legal databases
- **Email verification** for account activation
- **Role verification** through bar association records
- **Background checks** for admin/auditor roles

### Password Security
- **bcrypt hashing** with 12 rounds (industry standard)
- **Password complexity requirements**
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Mixed case, numbers, symbols
  - No dictionary words
- **Failed login attempt limits** (5 attempts before lockout)

### JWT Implementation
```typescript
// Token structure
interface JWTPayload {
  userId: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'counsel' | 'advocate' | 'auditor' | 'admin';
  permissions: string[];
  exp: number;  // 24 hours from issuance
  iat: number;
  jti: string;  // Unique token ID for revocation
}
```

## üîí Data Security

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- **Automatic hashing** of all PII using SHA-256
- **Consent-based access** to sensitive information
- **Data retention policies** with automatic purging
- **Right to deletion** for subjects upon request

### Evidence Security
- **Chain of custody** cryptographically verified
- **File integrity checks** using SHA-256 hashes
- **Metadata encryption** for location and timestamp data
- **Access logging** for all evidence interactions

### Database Security
- **Parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Connection encryption** using SSL/TLS
- **Row-level security** policies for sensitive data
- **Regular security audits** and penetration testing

---

## üö® Threat Model & Mitigation

### Potential Threats
1. **Unauthorized Access** - Mitigated by RBAC and MFA
2. **Data Tampering** - Mitigated by cryptographic integrity checks
3. **Evidence Manipulation** - Mitigated by immutable audit trails
4. **Insider Threats** - Mitigated by access logging and monitoring
5. **DDoS Attacks** - Mitigated by rate limiting and CDN

### Attack Vectors Addressed
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries and input sanitization
- **XSS Attacks**: Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- **CSRF Attacks**: Same-site cookies and token validation
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: TLS 1.3 encryption everywhere
- **Session Hijacking**: Secure cookie settings and token expiration

## üìä Compliance Framework

### Legal Compliance
- **Fifth Amendment**: Warnings for self-incriminating content
- **Fourth Amendment**: Warrant validity checking
- **Sixth Amendment**: Right to counsel and confrontation
- **Fourteenth Amendment**: Due process protection

### Privacy Regulations
- **GDPR Compliance**: Right to access, rectification, erasure
- **CCPA Compliance**: Data portability and opt-out rights
- **HIPAA Considerations**: Protected health information handling
- **FERPA Guidelines**: Educational record protection

### Industry Standards
- **OWASP Top 10**: All risks addressed in implementation
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management standards
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, confidentiality controls

---

## üîç Audit & Monitoring

### System Monitoring
- **Real-time alerting** for security events
- **Performance monitoring** with anomaly detection
- **Error tracking** and automated incident response
- **Resource usage monitoring** to detect attacks

### Security Logging
- **Comprehensive audit trails** for all user actions
- **File access logging** with timestamps and user identification
- **API call logging** with request/response details
- **Authentication event logging** for security analysis

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluation
